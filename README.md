# algorithms
At some point in my life it came to me that I really suck at algo... so fuck it i am gonna have my own fucking repo for algo practice.<br>

## Why Java?
All the C++ and C Gods better stay the fuck away from me. Java is far more easy to code in atleast for me and it is already my choice of language for prototyping or any proof of concepts.<br>

## Hey have you heard of Pytho..
Before you say that let me say....<br>
**BETTER STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME**<br>
<br>

## I found a Issue in your code
Alright create an issue.. Simple... BTW Helps are appreciated.<br>

## Have you heard of this Algorithm..
Create an issue stating the name of the algorithm and better attach a link to follow so that I DO NOT SEND A SCUFFED HACKER BEHIND YOU TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE. Please attach a link to the algorithm page too.<br>

## Hey you have such a bad language.
What kind of language do you expect from dumb ass person who has audacity to take up DSA because he thinks that he suck at coding. I hope you can feel the heat of a frustated coder. Anyways if are offended then I sorry and also better back off and **stay the FUCK away from this repo**.
